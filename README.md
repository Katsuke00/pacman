# Pacman

I wanted to try to write a simple "game" without reading any
algorithm or manuals.

Consider the following:
* I never used sdl2 before
* I never wrote a "game" before, without a engine.
* One day was spent to write this (writing the structure took a long time).
* I did not give attention to the code readability, as it's only a test.
* The Ghosts and foods are missing.
* The movements only work in straight lines.
